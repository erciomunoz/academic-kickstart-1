<h2 class='noTrickPadding' id='r4ds'>R for data science</h2>

The best place to start learning the tidyverse is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS for short), an O'Reilly book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's designed to take you from knowing nothing about R or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips. You can read it online for free, or [buy a physical copy](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1). 

<h2 class='stopFloatBefore' id="books">Books</h2>

* [Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the tidyverse](https://www.moderndive.com/) by
  Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. "Help! Iâ€™m new to R and RStudio and I need to learn them! What do I do?" If you're asking yourself this, this book is for you.

<h2>Workshops</h2>

  * [Mastering the Tidyverse](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/22_r-tidyverse) by Jumping Rivers. A one day crash course covering tidyverse fundamentals. The course is a mixture of lectures, short exercises and longer tutorial questions. During the day, we'll cover dplyr, tidy data, tibbles, dates/times and string manipulation.

<h2>University courses</h2>

<h3>2017</h3>
