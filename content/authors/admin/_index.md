Hi, thank you for visiting my website!

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in economics at CUNY Graduate Center writing my dissertation under the supervision of Nuria Rodriguez-Planas and Wim Vijverberg. I am also research associate at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality (since 2018) and consultant at the Development Research Group (Poverty and Inequality) of the World Bank (at the Bank since 2018 and DECPI since 2019). I have more than seven years of work experience and have previously also worked at the Central Bank of Chile and the Inter-American Development Bank.

My fields of specialization are applied econometrics and human resource economics. My main dissertation paper is on the geography of educational intergenerational mobility in Latin America and the Caribbean. A second theme of my research concerns measurement and statistical inference issues in applied work. I have a balanced portfolio that applies a diverse set of econometric techniques to topics spanning intergenerational mobility, earnings inequality, gender gaps, survey nonresponse, incumbency advantage, statistical inference in finance, and sports economics. I have a strong interest in empirical methods, co-authoring two new Stata commands that address survey nonresponse and sample selection in quantile regressions.
