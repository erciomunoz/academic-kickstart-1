Hi, thank you for visiting my website!

I am an economist currently working at the Poverty and Equity Global Practice of the World Bank. In my current role, I mostly work on fiscal incidence analysis and the implementation of a macro-micro modeling framework to analyze the distributional/poverty implications of climate change and related policies. I have more than seven years of work experience and have previously worked at the Central Bank of Chile and the Inter-American Development Bank. You can download my CV [here](https://www.erciomunoz.org/files/Munoz_resume.pdf).
