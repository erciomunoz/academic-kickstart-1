Hi, thank you for visiting my website!
I am Ph.D. candidate in economics at CUNY Graduate Center working under the supervision of Nuria Rodriguez-Planas and Wim Vijverberg. In addition, I am research associate at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality (since 2018), and consultant at Development Economics Research Group (Poverty and Inequality) in the World Bank (since 2019).
I have more than 7 years of work experience and previously worked at the Central Bank of Chile, the Inter-American Development Bank and others units of the World Bank.
