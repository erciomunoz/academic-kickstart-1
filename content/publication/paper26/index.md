abstract: This paper studies whether the observed differences across regions in upward intergenerational mobility in education in Latin America and the Caribbean are associated to sorting of families or they can be attributed to the effect of place. I exploit differences in the age of children at the time their families move across regions (districts or provinces) to isolate regional childhood exposure effects from sorting. I use 21 censuses that span 11 countries in the region and measure upward mobility as the likelihood of obtaining at least a primary education for individuals whose parents did not finish primary school. I find a convergence rate of 3.5% per year of exposure between the ages 1 to 11, which implies that children who move at age 1 would pick up approximately 10x3.5%=35% of the observed differences in upward mobility between their place of origin and their place of destination. In addition, I find significant selection effects of approximately 42%. This rate of convergence is remarkable similar to what has been recently documented for the US and Australia in terms of mobility in income, and Africa for the same metric of upward mobility in education. These results are robust to the use of a specification that identifies the effect of place within households (i.e., a comparison of siblings with different exposure to places). It is also robust to the use of a subset of data that consists of only anomalously high migration outflows, to instrumenting the choice of destination with historical migration, and a combination of both approaches. Finally, I also document regional childhood exposure effects in upward mobility using individuals aged 18-25 when secondary education is the level of interest. I find convergence rates that are even higher and imply that children by the age 18 may pick up approximately 90% of the difference in IGM when they move at age 1.
