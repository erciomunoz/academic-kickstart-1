abstract: This study analyzes the behavior of stock prices around the ex-dividend date focusing on the effects of a major tax reduction. Using the 40 most heavily traded shares on the Santiago Stock Exchange, the study evaluates price drop ratios using various measures of ex-dividend day prices. The findings indicate that the dividend tax reduction has an effect on the price drop ratio; this result is consistent with the clientele effect hypothesis.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The divided tax reduction affected the price drop ratios, consistent with the clienele effect hypothesis.
