abstract: In this paper I estimate intergenerational mobility in education using cross sectional data from 88 population and housing Censuses that span 23 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean over half a century. I measure upward mobility as the likelihood of finishing primary education for individuals with parents who did not finish it, and downward mobility as the likelihood of failing to complete primary education for individuals with parents who complete it. In addition, I explore the geography of intergenerational mobility, which is one of the key advantages of using this type of data set over household surveys, and has gained considerable attention over recent years due to the work with tax records in the United States. I document wide cross-country and within-country heterogeneity. At the country level, the distance between the most and least upwardly mobile is similar to what has been recently documented for Africa although the least mobile countries of this continent are less mobile. I do not find important differences by gender but I document a declining trend in the mobility gap between urban and rural populations. In terms of correlates, the level of mobility is highly correlated to the share of primary completion of the old generation, which suggests a high level of inertia. In contrast, geographical correlates do not appear to be highly correlated to mobility and some proxies of development at the beginning of the sample period are only correlated to downward mobility.
