abstract: "This article describes kmr, a Stata command to estimate a micro compliance function using groupâ€™s nonresponse rates (2007, Journal of Econometrics 136: 213-235), which can be used to correct survey weights for unit nonresponse. We illustrate the use of kmr with an empirical example using the Current Population Survey and state-level nonresponse rates."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
