abstract: Korinek, Mistiaen, and Ravallion 2007 (Journal of Econometrics 136: 213-235) proposes a 
method to correct the bias generated by unit nonresponse that depends on household characteristics 
such as income. They make use of Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 1997 to 2004. In this 
paper we replicate and extend their empirical results, confirming that response probability is 
strictly dependent on income levels. With one exception, we replicate in a ‘narrow sense’ the set
of year-by-year point estimates. In addition, we use data from 1977 to 2018 to extend the previous 
results along three dimensions. First, we show that the estimated parameters vary in an important 
way over time, especially during the last decade. Second, we find that the best specification 
changes over time but it often appears to be one that includes a quadratic term on income, which 
fits with recent evidence of non-monotonicity in response rates of the CPS. Finally, the adjustment 
of household survey weights for differential nonresponse results in substantial upward adjustments
for the Gini index (8.5% on average across years), top income shares (40% on average across years), 
total income (8.1% on average across years), and a downward correction in poverty rates (-8.1% on average across years).
